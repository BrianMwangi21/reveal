- MongoDB URI ready in .env

**Tech Decisions**:
- Framework: Next.js 16 (App Router)
- Database: MongoDB Atlas (Vercel-compatible, free tier)
- Real-Time: WebSocket/Pusher (Vercel limitations considered)
- Theme: Celebratory, warm color palette (gold, pink, blue, purple)

**Completed**:
- Created README.md with project overview, features, and tech stack
- Created ROADMAP.md with 8-phase development plan:
  1. Room Creation & Management
  2. Guest Join System
  3. Pre-Reveal Activities (Voting, Predictions, Message Board)
  4. Real-Time WebSocket Integration
  5. Countdown Timer & Reveal Logic
  6. UI/UX Design & Theming
  7. Post-Reveal Features
  8. Host Dashboard & Analytics
- Created AGENTS.md with development guidelines and best practices
- Created sessions/ directory for tracking work

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `README.md` - Project documentation
- `ROADMAP.md` - Development roadmap (8 phases)
- `AGENTS.md` - Agent development guidelines
- `sessions/` - Directory for session tracking

**Feature Highlights**:
- Room system with unique 6-digit codes
- Guest join system with nicknames
- Pre-reveal activities: Voting polls, Prediction pools, Message boards
- Simultaneous reveal with countdown timer

**Next Steps**:

- Set up MongoDB connection in `lib/db.ts`
- Create Room schema/model in `lib/models/Room.ts`
- Build room creation form UI

**Notes**:
- Modular approach with sessions tracking in sessions/ directory
- Vibe-coded app - keeping things simple
- MongoDB URI already configured in .env
- Consider Vercel WebSocket limitations for real-time features
